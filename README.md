## Bias detection in Wikipedia articles

This repository embrace Polish equivalent of the [WNC dataset](https://github.com/rpryzant/neutralizing-bias) which was the first parallel corpus of biased language. 
Similarly, we introduce the Polish corpus containing examples of biased and unbiased sentences scraped from Wikipedia articles. 
Part of the data was harvested with the use of code published by the WNC authors.

Collected data consists of subsets of sentences with slightly different characteristics.
- biased - biased sentences tagged in Wikipedia articles
- reviewed - reviewed version of previosly biased sentences
- unbiased - sentences from reviewed articles that were not marked as biased
- featured - sentences downloaded from [featured articles](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Artyku%C5%82y_na_Medal) - articles of very high quality
- deceiving_sentences - sentences tagges as [deceiving](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kategoria:Artyku%C5%82y_z_wyra%C5%BCeniami_zwodniczymi) in Polish Wikipedia
